#### What is Calling Convention?
This is actually just the description of how arguments are passed to a function when a function is called, and how the return value is passed back to the caller.
- Different conventions based on processor, OS, and language.
- It describes how arguments are passed to functions.
- It describes how values are returned from functions.
- It describes if the caller or callee cleans the stack.
- It responsible for function prologue and epilogue.

There many Calling Conventions, let's see some of them. And as said depend on what processor you have, on what OS you use (Linux, Windows.... 32bit, 64bit) and on language you use, you see lots of them. The ones that we are going to see are going to be visual studios or microsoft windows compiler calling conventions, because they are the ones that malwares use alot. 

#### Windows x86 Calling Conventions
- All arguments will expanded to the DWORD [32bit] when compiled to assembly.
- The return value also expanded to a DWORD [32bit] size and always is stored in EAX register.
- If the return value is  64bit (QWORD) wide then it return in EDX:EAX.
- If the return is a structure then the return value would be reference to structure inside EAX.
- Registers ESI, EDI, EBX add EBP are non-volatile and restored, that means they won't changed by the function call, the other registers can be changed by the function calls and you can't rely on those being constant but the four mentioned registers will be unchanged.

#### Calling Convention : \_\_cdecl
- This calling convention is the default one for C and C++ programs.
- All arguments are passed onto the stack by value. (right-to-left)
- The caller is responsible for cleaning the stack. 
- The \_\_cdecl is used in Microsoft compilers.
- Variadic functions use this convention because the callee don’t know how many arguments were passed.


#### Calling Convention : \_\_stdcall
- The callee is responsible for cleaning the stack.
- All arguments are passed onto the stack by value.
- All Win32 APIs use this standard.
- Functions using this calling convention requires a function prototype.
- The _stdcall is used by Microsoft compilers.


#### Calling Convention : \_\_fastcall
- This convention is only applied to x86 architecture.
- In Microsoft compilers, first two arguments are passed by register (ECX and EDX, respectively). All remaining arguments are passed via stack. Other compilers use different scheme.
- The callee is responsible for cleaning the stack.

#### Calling Convention : \_\_thiscall
- It’s the convention used for C++ class member functions on x86 architecture.
- The callee is responsible for cleaning the stack.
- The “this” pointer is passed through ECX register.
- “this” pointers are available for non-static C++ member functions.


#### Calling Convention : \_\_clrcall
- This determines that a function can only be called from a managed code.
- It must be used for virtual functions called from managed mode.
- This convention can’t be used for functions being called from native code.
