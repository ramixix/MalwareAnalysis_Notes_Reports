### General Information About Different Extensions

- CRX (ChoRme eXtension) : A file with the CRX file extension is a Chrome extension file used to extend the functionality of the Google Chrome web browser.  A CRX file is kind of like a renamed ZIP file, an archive/compression program, like PeaZip or 7-Zip (both free), should be able to open the file for expansion. If that doesn't work, use the [CRX Extractor](http://crxextractor.com/) website to save the extension as a ZIP file.

- XPI (Cross-Platform Install or XPInstall) : A file with the XPI file extension (pronounced "zippy") is a compressed installation archive used to extend the functionality of Mozilla products like Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird. An XPI file is really just a renamed ZIP file the program can use to install the add-on, whether it be a theme, plug-in, etc. They may include images and JS, MANIFEST, RDF, and CSS files, as well as multiple folders full of other data. Firefox uses XPI files to provide extensibility in the browser. Drag the file into any open Firefox window to install it. Since XPI files are really just .ZIP files, you can rename the file as such and then open it in any archive/compression program.
