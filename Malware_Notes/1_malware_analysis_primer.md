# Malware Analysis Preliminary Information

## What is Malware Analysis? 
Malware analysis is the art of dissecting malware to understand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it.

## The Goals of Malware Analysis?
The purpose of malware analysis is usually to provide the information you need to respond to a network intrusion. Your goals will typically be to determine exactly what happened, and to ensure that you’ve located all infected machines and files. When analyzing suspected malware, your goal will typically be to determine exactly what a particular suspect binary can do, how to detect it on your network, and how to measure and contain its damage. Once you identify which files require full analysis, it’s time to develop signatures to detect malware infections on your network.

- Host-based signatures, or indicators, are used to detect malicious code on victim computers. These indicators often identify files created or modified by the malware or specific changes that it makes to the registry. Unlike antivirus signatures, malware indicators focus on what the malware does to a system, not on the characteristics of the malware itself, which makes them more effective in detecting malware that changes form or that has been deleted from the hard disk.

- Network signatures are used to detect malicious code by monitoring network traffic. Network signatures can be created without malware analysis, but signatures created with the help of malware analysis are usually far more effective, offering a higher detection rate and fewer false positives.

## Malware Analysis Techniques
Most often, when performing malware analysis, you’ll have only the malware executable, which won’t be human-readable. In order to make sense of it, you’ll use a variety of tools and tricks, each revealing a small amount of information. You’ll need to use a variety of tools in order to see the full picture. There are two fundamental approaches to malware analysis: static and dynamic.
- Static analysis involves examining the malware without running it.
- Dynamic analysis involves running the malware.
Both techniques are further categorized as basic or advanced.

**Basic Static Analysis**
> Basic static analysis consists of examining the executable file without viewing the actual instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious, provide information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information that will allow you to produce simple network signatures. Basic static analysis is straightforward and can be quick, but it’s largely ineffective against sophisticated malware, and it can miss important behaviors.

**Basic Dynamic Analysis**
> Basic dynamic analysis techniques involve running the malware and observing its behavior on the system in order to remove the infection, produce effective signatures, or both. However, before you can run malware safely, you must set up an environment that will allow you to study the running malware without risk of damage to your system or network. Like basic static analysis techniques, basic dynamic analysis techniques can be used by most people without deep programming knowledge, but they won’t be effective with all malware and can miss important functionality.

**Advanced Static Analysis**
> Advanced static analysis consists of reverse-engineering the malware’s internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions in order to discover what the program does. The instructions are executed by the CPU, so advanced static analysis tells you exactly what the program does. However, advanced static analysis has a steeper learning curve than basic static analysis and requires specialized knowledge of disassembly, code constructs, and Windows operating system concepts.

**Advanced Dynamic Analysis**
> Advanced dynamic analysis uses a debugger to examine the internal state of a running malicious executable. Advanced dynamic analysis techniques provide another way to extract detailed information from an executable. These techniques are most useful when you’re trying to obtain information that is difficult to gather with the other techniques.
