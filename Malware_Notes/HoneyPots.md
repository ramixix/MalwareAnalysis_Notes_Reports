#### What are honeypots?
A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable security tool designed to attract attackers and record the actions of adversaries. Honeypots can be used in a defensive role to alert administrators of potential breaches and to distract attackers away from real infrastructure. Honeypots are also used to collect data on the tools and techniques of adversaries and assist with generating effective defensive measures.

#### Honeypot Interactivity and Classification
A wide variety of honeypots exist so it is helpful to classify them by the level of interactivity provided to adversaries, with most honeypots falling into one of the below categories:

- **Low-Interaction** honeypots offer little interactivity to the adversary and are only capable of simulating the functions that are required to simulate a service and capture attacks against it. Adversaries are not able to perform any post-exploitation activity against these honeypots as they are unable to fully exploit the simulated service. Examples of low-interaction honeypots include mailoney and dionaea.
    
- **Medium-Interaction** honeypots collect data by emulating both vulnerable services as well as the underlying OS, shell, and file systems. This allows adversaries to complete initial exploits and carry out post-exploitation activity. Note, that unlike, High-Interaction honeypots (see below), the system presented to adversaries is a simulation. As a result, it is usually not possible for adversaries to complete their full range of post-exploitation activity as the simulation will be unable to function completely or accurately. We will be taking a look at the medium-interaction SSH honeypot, Cowrie in this demo.

-  **High-Interaction** honeypots are fully complete systems that are usually Virtual Machines that include deliberate vulnerabilities. Adversaries should be able (but not necessarily allowed) to perform any action against the honeypot as it is a complete system. It is important that high-interaction honeypots are carefully managed, otherwise, there is a risk that an adversary could use the honeypot as a foothold to attack other resources. Cowrie can also operate as an SSH proxy and management system for high-interaction honeypots.

Deployment Location
Once deployed, honeypots can then be further categorized by the exact location of their deployment:

- **Internal honeypots** are deployed inside a LAN. This type can act as a way to monitor a network for threats originating from the inside, for example, attacks originating from trusted personnel or attacks that by-parse firewalls like phishing attacks. Ideally, these honeypots should never be compromised as this would indicate a significant breach.

- **External honeypots** are deployed on the open internet and are used to monitor attacks from outside of the LAN. These honeypots are able to collect much more data on attacks since they are effectively guaranteed to be under attack at all times.


## Cowrie Honeypot
The Cowrie honeypot can work both as an SSH proxy or as a simulated shell. In simulated Shell most of the commands work like how you'd expect, and the contents of the file system match. However, there are ways to identify this type of Cowrie deployment. For example, it's not possible to execute bash scripts as this is a limitation of low and medium interaction honeypots. It's also possible to identify the default installation as it will mirror a Debian 5 Installation and features a user account named Phil. The default file system also references an outdated CPU.

**How would you disable bash history using unset?**
> unset HISTFILE
> To Automatically and permanently disable it :
> echo "unset HISTFILE" >> /etc/profile.d/disable_bash.sh
